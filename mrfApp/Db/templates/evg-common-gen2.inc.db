# Interrupt flag register (only parts specific to -300 series devices).

# Interrupt enable register (only parts specific to -300 series devices).

# TODO This has to go into the evg-interrupts-….db files, because all interrupt
#   flags are read at once and the exact mechanism also depends on whether
#   using the Linux kernel driver or the UDP/IP based protocol.

# AC trigger control register (only parts specific to -300 series devices).

# TODO Replace @PV_PREFIX@ACSync:SyncSource with an mbbo record. This also
#   means that the existing record has to be removed from evg-common.inc.db and
#   moved to evg-common-gen1.inc.db.

# Data buffer control register (only parts specific to -300 series devices).

# TODO @PV_PREFIX@DBus:SharedTX must be fixed to one, because the DC firmware
#   does not support disabling data transmission. This means that the existing
#   record has to be moved from evg-common.inc.db to evg-common-gen1.inc.db.
