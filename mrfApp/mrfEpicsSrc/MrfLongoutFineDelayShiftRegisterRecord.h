/**
 * Device support class for a longout record that handles the shift register
 * used to control the fine delay of certain universal output modules. On of
 * these records is always responsible for setting the fine delay of two outputs
 * (which both use the same universal output module).
 *
 * When the record is processed, a series of write operations is started, which
 * use four GPIO outputs to configure the two delay chips on a universal output
 * module through their common shift register.
 *
 * The value stored in the record is interpreted in the following way: Bits
 * 0-9 store the delay for the first output and bits 16-25 store the delay for
 * the second output. Bit 10 stores the latch enable bit for the first output
 * and bit 26 stores the latch enable bit for the second output. Typically,
 * these bits should both be zero. If they are not zero, updating the
 * corresponding delay value does not have any effect. Bit 31 is used for the
 * output disable signal. If this bit is set, both outputs are tri-stated,
 * effectively disabling them. The least significant bit is bit 0.
